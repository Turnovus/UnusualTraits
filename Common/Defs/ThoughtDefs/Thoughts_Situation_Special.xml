        <label>low psychic drone</label>
        <description>It's like a scratching at the back of my mind. Another voice, whispering. I can only make out a few words, and I like them.</description>

        <label>moderate psychic drone</label>
        <description>I feel like someone is always just out of sight, speaking to me. The voice changes but the message doesn't. I'm supposed to hurt people. How exciting!</description>

        <label>high psychic drone</label>
        <description>The voice is incredibly loud. It's quite cathartic, in a way.</description>

      <li>
        <label>extreme psychic drone</label>
        <description>My heart pounds and I'm sweating. All I can think of is hurting and suffering and all these enemies around me. It's like a dream.</description>
